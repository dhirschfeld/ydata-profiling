.. NOTE::
   **Want to run data profiling directly from your databases?**

   check `YData Fabric Data Catalog <https://ydata.ai/products/data_catalog>`_, which allows you to consume data 
   from different types of storages such as RDBMs (Azure SQL, PostGreSQL, Oracle, etc.), 
   object storages (Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3, Snowflake, etc.), among others. 
   From single profiling to a trustable and scalable Data Catalog for data teams.
